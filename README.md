# Let Me Teleport
A simple mod that fixes the "*player* moved too quickly!" messages that are spammed in the console when the server tells a player to teleport more than ~100 blocks, whether by command or switching dimensions. It appears that Mojang tried to fix this, but they implemented their fix incorrectly and it does not work; this mod effectively fixes their broken fix.\
Fixes [MC-248231](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-248231).
